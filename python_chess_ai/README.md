# Realization

This will be implemented using different modules listed below (first draw / idea):

- Controller: Frontend / Backend communication
- UI Controller: 
	- Coordinate Communication
	- _(Optional)_ Switch input method between GUI and Terminal
- Start menu / Settings (interface; implemented for GUI & terminal)
	- Choose game mode
		- Player vs AI 
		- AI vs AI
		- _(Optional)_ Trainer (Monte Carlo)
		- _(Optional)_ chess.com API (or similar) vs AI
	- _(Optional)_ Choose difficulty
		- Define time for Iterative Deepening
		- Used methods (board value, attacked figures, monte carlo history)
	- _(Optional)_ Recording board for history 
- Player IO (interface; implemented for GUI & terminal)
	- Get Player move 
	- Print board 
	- Surrender
- Chess master
	- Start game / Create board 
	- Organize turns (player / ai)
	- Force board print / refresh after every turn 
	- _(Optional)_ record board 
	- End game
	- _(Optional)_ Grooming board record
- Player controller (abstract; implemented for User, AI, _(Optional)_ Monte Carlo & _(Optional)_ API)
	- Get move (via UI / AI calculation)
	- push move to board 
	- check for surrender 
- AI engine 
	- combine algorithms
		- iterative deepening
			- Calculate board value 
			-(Optional)_ Calculate attacked figures 
		- _(Optional)_ get board value by board dataset
- Chess logic library 
	- Calculate board value 
	- Calculate attacked figures + value 
-(Optional) chess.com API library
	- get board
	- push moves 
	- recognize end of match (chess mate & surrender)
